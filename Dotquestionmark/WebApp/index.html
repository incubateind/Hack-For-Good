<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

<p class="long-copy">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory disease that can spread from one person to the other. There are many types of human coronaviruses, including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.Symptoms that are currently reported by the patients suffering from COVID-19 have reported mild to severe respiratory illness, along with fever, cough, and difficulty in breathing.</p>
</div>

<div class="row js--wp-1">
<div class="col span-1-of-4 box">
<h3>What is a novel coronavirus</h3>

<p>A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. This virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the previously identified coronaviruses, which commonly circulated among humans and caused common cold and mild fever.</p>
</div>

<div class="col span-1-of-4 box">
<h3>Does COVID-19 present a risk to the safety of the nation&rsquo;s blood supply</h3>

<p>Since respiratory viruses are not transmitted through blood transfusion, and no such cases of transfusion-transmitted coronavirus have been reported so far, it does not present a risk to the safety of Nation&#39;s blood supply.</p>
</div>

<div class="col span-1-of-4 box">
<h3>Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating COVID-19</h3>

<p>No. Antibiotics are not effective against viruses.This is beacuse, antibiotics work on bacterial infections only. Since COVID-19 is caused by a virus, antibiotics will not be useful.</p>
</div>

<div class="col span-1-of-4 box">
<h3>Can SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, be transmitted by blood transfusion</h3>

<p>In general, respiratory viruses are not known to be transmitted by blood transfusion, and there have been no reported cases of transfusion-transmitted coronavirus.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="row js--wp-1">
<div class="col span-1-of-4 box">
<h3>Are there any vaccines or other medical products to prevent COVID-19</h3>

<p>Currently, no particular vaccine has been introduced to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, the FDA, that is Food and Drug Administration, is working with vaccine developers and other researchers and manufacturers to help expedite the development and availability of medical products such as vaccines, antibodies, and drugs to prevent COVID-19.</p>
</div>

<div class="col span-1-of-4 box">
<h3>If I have COVID-19, can I infect my pet? Can I get COVID-19 from my pet</h3>

<p>There is currently no evidence that pets can spread COVID-19 or that they might be a source of infection in the United States. It is advised that if you are sick with COVID-19, limit the contact with your pet, including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food, wash hands before and after you interact with pets.</p>
</div>

<div class="col span-1-of-4 box">
<h3>Why aren&rsquo;t blood centers testing donors for SARS-CoV-2</h3>

<p>At this time, the FDA does not recommend using laboratory tests to screen blood. Someone who has symptoms of COVID-19, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath, is not healthy enough to donate blood. Standard screening processes already in place will mean that someone with these symptoms will not be allowed to donate.</p>
</div>

<div class="col span-1-of-4 box">
<h3>Should I purchase personal protective equipment such as facemasks or N95 respirators</h3>

<p>CDC does not recommend that people who are well to wear a facemask, beacuse everyone might not be able to wear a respirator. Wearing a mask might make breathing through a repirator quite difficult. However, patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 should wear a facemask along with the health workers and other people who are close to someone who is infected with COVID-19.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="row js--wp-1">
<div class="col span-1-of-4 box">
<h3>Can animals get novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19)</h3>

<p>No evidence that animals might become a source of infection. However, more than one dog have been tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19, based on information from the Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries &amp; Conservation DepartmentExternal Link Disclaimer.</p>
</div>

<div class="col span-1-of-4 box">
<h3>Is there a test for COVID-19</h3>

<p>The FDA has also issued new policies and guidance to achieve more rapid testing capacity in the U.S. Since the virus that causes COVID-19, that is SARS-CoV-2 is new, there is no particular FDA-approved or cleared test to diagnose or detect COVID-19 currently.</p>
</div>

<div class="col span-1-of-4 box">
<h3>Can I get sick with COVID-19 from touching food, the food packaging, or food contact surfaces, if the coronavirus was present on it</h3>

<p>Currently, no evidence for transmission of COVID-19 through food or packaging has been found. It is likely that the virus that causes COVID-19 can survive on surfaces or objects.</p>

<div class="col span-3-of-3">
<blockquote>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don&rsquo;t develop any symptoms and don&#39;t feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention. <cite><img src="resources/img/who.png" />WHO</cite></blockquote>
