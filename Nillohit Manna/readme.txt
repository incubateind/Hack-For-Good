---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------PRODUCT DESCRIPTION-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

In this time and date, there are a lot of non profit organization and NGO'S going around different parts of our country risking their life to aid the poor and needy people providing them 
with clothes, food, surgical masks and many other day to day necesseties which cannot be obtained by some during this c. So basically we aim to make a website where these NGO'S or other 
non profit organisation or rather anyone can register and make an account and we will conduct a background check orisisn their activities. We will Oct as a medium between these NGO'S and 
the people of our nation or any other country willing to donate money to these people to aid in their charitable work, since these ngo's lack proper funds and require all the support they 
can get from the our people. Our website will also act as a platform where the people can check in on the progress of the ngo's, their day to day activities and see the progress they make.
