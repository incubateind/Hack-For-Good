Due to this pandemic situation, the whole country has been divided into three zones i.e. red, green, and orange. There has been a lot of theoretical data for the same but no visual data. And thus, people are less aware of these zones. 
Also, now that govt. is started to run out of money, a recent announcement was to not quarantine the people travelling intra-state.
The solution presented here, keeps a visual representation of these various zones along with continuously monitoring the people based on their location. The people will be represented by the colored markers respective to the highest risk zone they have ever been in.
What problems does the solution solve?
By continuously having a track of people from different zones, people xcan be more self aware. Also now that more and more public places have started to be open, this tracking can be useful to have a controlled access to places.
Also, daily hundreds of labourers are moving toward their home, using this tracker app, govt. can also keep a track of whether they have been travelling from a red zone or not and then accordingly quarantine specific ones.
